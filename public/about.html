<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Devin Ho, and I am 21 years old (as of the time of writing). My birthday is May 13, 2003. I am the son of Kevin Ho and Ilene Huynh. I'm 5'9'' half viet half chinese boy. I am very relaxed and laid back but I still lock in when needed.  I am looking to become a Web Developer to get my foot in the door of the computer science world.</p>

<p>Out of the three jobs Iâ€™ve had in my life, two were in the food industry. My current occupation is as an EMT-B. I was initially interested in medicine, but after experiencing what that career was like, I realized that a life of no sleep and dirty hands was not for me. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed helping others, but it was just too taxing on me. I find programming to be a fun endeavor, and I am excited to expand my skill set.</p>

<p>Growing up, I was really into video games, and I still am. However, coding video games turned out to be less exciting than I initially thought it would be. Oddly enough, I enjoy coding websites more than games. I've made a few small projects (if you can call them that) in Unity using C# that I think are okay, but not worth showing off.</p>

<p>I spend my time on the computer either coding, playing games, or working as an EMT. I am particularly into Destiny 2 and games that I can really sink my teeth into. For me, gaming transitioned from a way to have fun and escape school to a way to relax when I'm not working. However, I'm not a shut-in! I enjoy talking to people and making friends as well.</p>

<p>School was an enjoyable experience for me. Out of all the friends I made in high school, I only still talk to the ones I truly value and consider close friends. My biggest disappointment regarding school was not getting to experience my senior year due to COVID-19. My grades were good throughout high school; I finished with a 3.5 GPA, which I am happy with.</p>

<p>College was a different story. I initially enrolled at Harrisburg Area Community College, but it was not for me. For starters, my family is not very wealthy, and college was going to be a significant financial burden. My parents managed to save some money over the years to help pay for it, but I told them not to use it on me and to save it for my younger sister, who will be going to college in a few years. The college environment was not enjoyable for me, especially since I attended during COVID and took online classes. After a few months, I dropped out and entered the workforce to figure out my next steps. I worked at Jersey Mike's and eventually took a training program for EMTs. Fast forward a year, and here I am, aspiring to be a self-taught Web Developer to enter the next stage of my life.</p>
